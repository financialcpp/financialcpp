what do the programs need to do?

Program 1 - C++ download data from ActiveTick

1. download data from previous days
2. Invent a file structure that makes sense to store the data files
3. Have data from last 2 months (should be good enough for now to backtest)

Program 2 - Python backtester

1. import data into pandas dataframes
2. build appropriate features in the dataframe
3. filter the features and try new stuff
4. make sure it's easy to manipulate things
5. don't hardcode values, make sure variables are easy to change
